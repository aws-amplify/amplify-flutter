# amplify_authenticator_example

This is the example application for the Amplify Flutter Authenticator

## Getting Started

- Create an Amplify [project](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/flutter#n1-create-a-new-project) with a [Cognito resource](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/flutter).

- If you are running this application directly from a clone of the [Amplify Flutter GithHub repository](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter) and are interested in local development using the other Amplify packages, you can run:

  - `flutter pub global activate melos`
  - from the root of the amplify-flutter directory, `melos bootstrap`

- If you are **not** running this application directly from the Amplify Flutter repository or do want to modify other Amplify packages, you can run:

  - `Run flutter pub get` from the Amplify Authenticator example app root directory.

- Finally, run `flutter start`.
