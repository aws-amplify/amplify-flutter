# amplify_authenticator

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Amplify Flutter Authenticator is meant to bring customers and end-users
a seamless experience while using authentication in Flutter applications.

The authenticator uses a native solution for state management to avoid conflicts
between existing dependencies.

The overall architecture of the authenticator is composed by a View Model, that
handles all the data coming from the client side, and by a BLoC pattern that
separates all the business logic from the User Interface.

## Getting Started

TODO:

1. Refactor previous PoC into a library.
2. Migrate authenticator to NULL SAFETY.
3. SignUp & ConfirmSignUp screens implementation.
4. SignIn, ConfirmSignIn and Password screens implementation.
5. Integrate testing.
=======
A new Flutter package project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
