# amplify_authenticator

The Amplify Flutter Authenticator is meant to bring customers and end-users
a seamless experience while using authentication in Flutter applications.

The authenticator uses a native solution for state management to avoid conflicts
between existing dependencies.

The overall architecture of the authenticator is composed by a View Model, that
handles all the data coming from the client side, and by a BLoC pattern that
separates all the business logic from the User Interface.

## Getting Started

TODO:

1. Refactor previous PoC into a library.
2. Migrate authenticator to NULL SAFETY.
3. SignUp & ConfirmSignUp screens implementation.
4. SignIn, ConfirmSignIn and Password screens implementation.
5. Integrate testing.
