# amplify_authenticator_example

An example app for the Authenticator.

## Using Localization

To enable localization for this application, you can add a file called `l10n.yaml` at the root of this app:

```yaml
arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: amplify_en.arb
output-localization-file: amplify_localizations.dart
```

See the comments in `main.dart` and `pubspec.yaml` - you will need to modify/uncomment several lines.
