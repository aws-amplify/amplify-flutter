    /// This was to skip over already in-flight mutation events and grab the next one. However, it was observed in highly
    /// concurrent calls to `DataStore.start()` /`stop()` / `save()` that it will interrupt the
    /// **OutgoingMutationQueue** of processing and deleting a **MutationEvent** . `DataStore.start()`,
    /// which starts the remote sync engine, should perform a step to move all `InProcess` **MutationEvents** back
    /// to false, however there's a timing issue that is difficult to pinpoint. **OutgoingMutationQueue**'s query manages
    /// to pick up the second MutationEvent in the queue and sends it off, while the first one that is marked as `inProcess`
    /// isn't being processed, likely that process was already cancelled. The query below was updated to always dequeue the
    /// first regardless of `InProcess` in the [PR #3492](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift/pull/3492).
    /// By removing the filter, there is a small chance that the same event may be sent twice. Sending the event twice is idempotent
    /// and the second response will be `ConditionalCheckFailed`. The `InProcess` flag is still needed for the
    /// handling consecutive update scenarios.
