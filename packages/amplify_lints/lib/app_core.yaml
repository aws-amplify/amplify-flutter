    - avoid_catches_without_on_clauses                 # To encourage thoughtfulness when introducing catch clauses and to avoid catching Errors unless specifically required.
    - avoid_catching_errors                            # To avoid catching runtime errors which need attention.
    - cancel_subscriptions                             # To avoid memory leaks and to prevent code from firing after a subscription is no longer being used.
    - close_sinks                                      # To avoid memory leaks.
    - directives_ordering                              # To maintain visual separation of a fileâ€™s imports.
    - only_throw_errors                                # To ensure downstream exception handling always works.
    - prefer_if_elements_to_conditional_expressions    # To make large lists easier to read and navigate.
    - prefer_single_quotes                             # To encourage consistent styling.
    - sort_pub_dependencies                            # To simplify searching a large list.
    - unnecessary_await_in_return                      # To make code more concise and to encourage mindfulness about where Futures are awaited.
    - unnecessary_lambdas                              # To make code more concise.
    - use_build_context_synchronously                  # To prevent asynchronous usage of an invalid BuildContext.
