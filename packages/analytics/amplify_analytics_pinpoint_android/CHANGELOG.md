## 1.0.0-next.0 (2022-08-02)

Initial developer preview release for all platforms.

### Developer Preview

The Amplify Flutter libraries are being rewritten in Dart. This version is part of our developer preview for all platforms and is **not** intended for production usage. Please follow our [Web](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/234) and [Desktop](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/133) support tickets to monitor the status of supported categories. We will be releasing Web and Desktop support for all Amplify categories incrementally.

For production use cases please use the latest, non-tagged versions of amplify-flutter packages from `pub.dev`. They offer a stable, production-ready experience for Android and iOS.
