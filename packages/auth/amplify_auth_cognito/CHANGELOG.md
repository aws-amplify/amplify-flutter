We are thrilled to release version 1.0 of the Amplify Flutter libraries!

This release introduces a full rewrite of the Amplify libraries in Dart, allowing you to build AWS cloud-connected
applications on every platform Flutter supports (iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux).

If you've been using v0 in production, you can now safely migrate to v1. Check out our 
[migration guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/upgrade-guide/q/platform/flutter/) for 
more information.

As always, you can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/) and 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/jWVbPfC) to answer any questions.

### New Features in the Auth category

* `fetchAuthSession` now supports a `forceRefresh` parameter which, when passed, will refresh User Pool tokens and AWS credentials regardless if theyâ€™ve expired.
* The result of `Amplify.Auth.signUp` now provides the user ID of the created user. Previously this was only available after signing in.
* Custom OAuth providers are now configurable when signing in via Hosted UI.
* A new `federateToIdentityPool` API has been added to the Cognito plugin which allows federating directly into an Identity Pool to receive AWS credentials using a third-party identity provider (IdP) token.
    * **Note:** Since this method is only available on the Cognito plugin, it must be called directly on the plugin. The Cognito plugin can be retrieved by calling `Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito.pluginKey)` anytime after configuration.
    * This method prevents usage of any User Pool-related methods. It should only be used in scenarios where you need AWS credentials and already have a mechanism for retrieving OIDC tokens from a third-party IdP.
