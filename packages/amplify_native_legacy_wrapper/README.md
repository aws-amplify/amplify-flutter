# amplify_native_legacy_wrapper

A wrapper around the v1 native Amplify plugins and the legacy native SDKs.

On Android, this wraps the Java SDK directly. On iOS, this wraps the v1 Amplify plugins instead of the SDK since using the Objective-c SDK directly requires significant boilerplate.

> NOTE: This plugin is only intended to be used in tests.
