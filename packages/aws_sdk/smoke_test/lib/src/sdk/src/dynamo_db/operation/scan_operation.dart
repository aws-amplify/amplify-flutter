/// The `Scan` operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a `FilterExpression` operation.
///
/// If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The `LastEvaluatedKey` value is also returned and the requestor can use the `LastEvaluatedKey` to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (ScannedCount) as part of the request. If using a `FilterExpression`, a scan result can result in no items meeting the criteria and the `Count` will result in zero. If you did not use a `FilterExpression` in the scan request, then `Count` is the same as `ScannedCount`.
///
/// `Count` and `ScannedCount` only return the count of items specific to a single scan request and, unless the table is less than 1MB, do not represent the total number of items in the table.
///
/// A single `Scan` operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the `Limit` parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if a `FilterExpression` is provided. If `LastEvaluatedKey` is present in the response, pagination is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see [Paginating the Results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.Pagination) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.
///
/// `Scan` operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel `Scan` operation by providing the `Segment` and `TotalSegments` parameters. For more information, see [Parallel Scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.
///
/// By default, a `Scan` uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent `Scan` may not include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table. If you require a strongly consistent read of each item as the scan iterates through the items in the table, you can set the `ConsistentRead` parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of the read at the item level.
