If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.

  /// When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can use other appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying. For more information about server-side encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html).

  /// By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see [Accessing a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro).
  ///
  /// If you send your create bucket request to the `s3.amazonaws.com` endpoint, the request goes to the `us-east-1` Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use `us-east-1` as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html).
  ///
  /// Permissions
  ///
  /// In addition to `s3:CreateBucket`, the following permissions are required when your `CreateBucket` request includes specific headers:
  ///
  /// *   **Access control lists (ACLs)** \- If your `CreateBucket` request specifies access control list (ACL) permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both `s3:CreateBucket` and `s3:PutBucketAcl` permissions are needed. If the ACL for the `CreateBucket` request is private or if the request doesn't specify any ACLs, only `s3:CreateBucket` permission is needed.
  ///
  /// *   **Object Lock** \- If `ObjectLockEnabledForBucket` is set to true in your `CreateBucket` request, `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` and `s3:PutBucketVersioning` permissions are required.
  ///
  /// *   **S3 Object Ownership** \- If your `CreateBucket` request includes the `x-amz-object-ownership` header, then the `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls` permission is required. By default, `ObjectOwnership` is set to `BucketOWnerEnforced` and ACLs are disabled. We recommend keeping ACLs disabled, except in uncommon use cases where you must control access for each object individually. If you want to change the `ObjectOwnership` setting, you can use the `x-amz-object-ownership` header in your `CreateBucket` request to set the `ObjectOwnership` setting of your choice. For more information about S3 Object Ownership, see [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
  ///
  /// *   **S3 Block Public Access** \- If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block Public Access. You can create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the [`DeletePublicAccessBlock`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeletePublicAccessBlock.html) API. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. By default, all Block Public Access settings are enabled for new buckets. To avoid inadvertent exposure of your resources, we recommend keeping the S3 Block Public Access settings enabled. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
  ///
  ///
  /// If your `CreateBucket` request sets `BucketOwnerEnforced` for Amazon S3 Object Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a `400` error and returns the `InvalidBucketAcLWithObjectOwnership` error code.

  /// For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).
  ///
  /// After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

  /// Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using `CreateMultipartUpload`. You can request that Amazon S3 save the uploaded parts encrypted with server-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3), an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C).
  ///
  /// To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
  ///
  /// If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy.

  ///
  /// When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

  /// When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the `cors` configuration on the bucket and uses the first `CORSRule` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:
  ///
  /// *   The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.
  ///
  /// *   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case of a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.
  ///
  /// *   Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header of a pre-flight request must match an `AllowedHeader` element.

  /// Restoring objects
  ///
  /// Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.
  ///
  /// To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
  ///
  /// When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the `Tier` element of the request body:
  ///
  /// *   `Expedited` \- Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
  ///
  /// *   `Standard` \- Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
  ///
  /// *   `Bulk` \- Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

  ///
  /// To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request. Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
  ///
  /// After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.
  ///
  /// If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.

  /// In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) operation.
  ///
  /// You must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.
  ///
  /// Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.

  /// To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
  ///
  /// If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).
  ///
  /// **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

  /// Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have three mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C). If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html). For more information, go to [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
  ///
  /// Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).
