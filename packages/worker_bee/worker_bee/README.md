# Worker Bee

> This project is an experimental multiplatform concurrency solution used internally in Amplify client libraries. There are currently no plans to support this for external use. If you'd like to use this outside of Amplify, please open a ticket in our [repo](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues) and share with us your use case.
