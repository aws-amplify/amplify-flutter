We are thrilled to release version 1.0 of the Amplify Flutter libraries!

This release introduces a full rewrite of the Amplify libraries in Dart, allowing you to build AWS cloud-connected
applications on every platform Flutter supports (iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux).

If you've been using v0 in production, you can now safely migrate to v1. Check out our 
[migration guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/upgrade-guide/q/platform/flutter/) for 
more information.

As always, you can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/) and 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/jWVbPfC) to answer any questions.

### New Features in the Storage Category

* In-flight download and upload operations are now fully controllable.
    * NOTE: Downloading and uploading in the background is not yet supported.
* The `list` API now supports pagination.
* The new APIs `uploadData` and `downloadData` provide flexibility when dealing with data stored in memory.
    * `uploadData` supports uploading from various data formats such as raw bytes, JSON, strings, Data URLs, and more.
* The new API `getProperties` allows retrieving S3 object metadata without downloading the object. 
* New `copy`, `move`, and `removeMany` APIs now support better control of your files.
* Prefix customization is now supported.
