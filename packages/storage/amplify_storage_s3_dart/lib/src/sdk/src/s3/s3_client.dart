  /// To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. When you grant permissions, you can use the `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see [Specifying Conditions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using `CreateMultipartUpload`.
  ///
  /// To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.

For more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).

  ///
  /// Note the following additional considerations about the request headers `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`, `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`, `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`, and `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`:
  ///
  /// *   **Consideration 1** \- If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request as follows:
  ///
  ///     `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
  ///
  ///     `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to `false`;
  ///
  ///     Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.
  ///
  /// *   **Consideration 2** \- If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request as follows:
  ///
  ///     `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;
  ///
  ///     `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;
  ///
  ///     Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.
  ///
  ///
  /// **Versioning**
  ///
  /// If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source`, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the `x-amz-copy-source`.
  ///
  /// You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the `versionId` subresource as shown in the following example:
  ///
  /// `x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id`
  ///
  /// **Special Errors**
  ///
  /// *   *   _Code: NoSuchUpload_
  ///
  ///     *   _Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed._
  ///
  ///     *   _HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found_
  ///
  /// *   *   _Code: InvalidRequest_
  ///
  ///     *   _Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source._
