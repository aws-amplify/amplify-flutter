/// This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
///
/// After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.
///
/// If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload.

You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests.

///
///     To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
///
/// *   **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .

/// Encryption
///
/// *   **General purpose buckets** \- Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) requests must match the headers you used in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request.
///
///     *   Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.
