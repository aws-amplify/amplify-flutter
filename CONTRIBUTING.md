# Our History and Ethos

AWS Amplify aims to enhance the development experience using JavaScript with AWS. Amplify codifies best practices through programmatic interfaces to help you effortlessly interact with cloud resources.

First and foremost Amplify exposes to you WHAT things do and then HOW best to do them. The WHAT is at a functional use case with HOW being an opinionated implementation that you can override with “escape hatches.” This will allow you to have higher velocity and build better applications by focusing less on implementation choices. Secondly, Amplify should be a manifestation of The Rule of Least Power when developing against AWS. This means it encourages architectural and programmatic best practices and the ability to start quickly. This shows by encouraging certain services (API Gateway usage vs. direct DynamoDB interaction) or certain connection patterns (Circuit breaker, retry counts and throttle up/down).

Opinionated implementations: There are many ways to interface with AWS Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and performance through library decisions.

Declarative actions: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client object and the ability to perform common actions. “RegisterUser”, “Login”, “SendObject”, “UpdateObject”, “StreamData”. By default you should not need to worry about AWS Service specific API operations like putItem() with a unique hash or even HTTP verbs.

Cascading service interactions: Certain actions in a declarative style can have overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations. With an opinionated implementation, we can decide which Services are "primary" and which are "secondary" depending on what is configured. For instance, sending an image will prefer S3 over API Gateway.

Simple, standard data objects: Sending & receiving data to AWS Services can have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys, etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow focus on state and data types only.

# Our Design

As more and more modules were introduced to AWS Amplify, it became necessary to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward-compatible to avoid breaking changes.

Modular import prevents unnecessary code dependencies from being included with the app, and thus decreases the bundle size while enabling added new functionality without the risk of introducing errors related to unused code.

Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.

# Development Process

Our work is done directly on Github and PR's are sent to the github repo by core team members and contributors. Everyone undergoes the same review process to get their changes into the repo.

## Setting up for local development

This section should get you running with **Amplify Flutter** and get you familiar with the basics of the codebase.

Start by, [Forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the main branch of [amplify-flutter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter).

You will need to install `melos` for dependency management.
Run `melos bootstrap` to link local packages together and install remaining dependencies.

Note that running `flutter pub get` in the packages is no longer required, because `melos bootstrap` has
already installed all the dependencies.

See [invertase/melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) for more instructions on how to use `melos`.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[username]/amplify-flutter.git
$ cd amplify-flutter
$ flutter pub global activate melos
$ melos bootstrap
```

> Note: If you don't include `melos` on your path, you may execute `flutter pub global run melos bootstrap` instead of the last command above.

> Note: Make sure to always [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) with main branch of amplify-flutter

#### Packages inside Amplify Flutter

- [amplify_flutter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_flutter)
- [amplify_auth_plugin_interface](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_auth_plugin_interface)
- [amplify_auth_cognito](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_auth_cognito)
- [amplify_analytics_plugin_interface](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_analytics_plugin_interface)
- [amplify_analytics_pinpoint](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_analytics_pinpoint)

## Steps towards contributions

Each packages/[category] contains the following for testing:

1. `example` folder with a Dart test app for testing that specific category. In order to run these apps, you must include your own `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file in the `lib` folder.
2. `android/src/test/kotlin/.... Test.kt` file. This is where Android unit tests are written.
3. `test/ ... test.dart` file. This is where Dart unit tests are written.

The general organization of the Flutter library is as follows:

1. Each [category] has a corresponding `amplify_[category]_plugin_interface` where its public method set is defined.

2. A given [category] can have multiple plugins corresponding to different AWS services. For example Analytics will have a Pinpoint and Kinesis plugin.

3. The [category] plugins (ie. amplify_auth_cognito, amplify_storage_s3, etc.) is a Dart shell that uses the MethodChannel to communicate with native iOS and Android code which in turn calls the corresponding Amplify Android and Amplify iOS library code.

Contributing:

1. To start contributing make a fork of this repo and create a branch where you will make your changes to a particular `packages/[category]`.

2. Write unit tests in android and dart.

3. Update the example app to use your new changes (if applicable) and to build the app on iOS and Android.

4. Run the test suite

5. Submit a PR

# Pull Requests

This is mostly the same as GitHub's guide on creating a pull request.

_[Skip step 1 to 3 if you have already done this]_

1. Fork aws-amplify/amplify-flutter
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/amplify-flutter.git`
3. Install `melos` by running `flutter pub global activate melos`, and run `melos bootstrap` (or `flutter pub global run melos bootstrap`) in the repository root
4. Within your fork, create a new branch based on the issue (e.g. Issue #123) you're addressing - `git checkout -b "group-token/short-token-[branch-name]"` or `git checkout -b "short-token/[branch-name]"`
   - Use grouping tokens at the beginning of the branch names. \_For e.g, if you are working on changes specific to `amplify-ui-components`, then you could start the branch name as `ui-components/...`
   - short token
     - feat
     - chore
     - bug
   - use slashes to separate parts of branch names
   - Hyphenate well defined branch name
5. Once your work is committed and you're ready to share, run tests.
   **Note:** Manually test your changes in a sample app with different edge cases and also test across different native platforms
6. Then, Push your branch `git push origin -u`
7. This previous step will give you a URL to view a GitHub page in your browser. Copy-paste this, and complete the workflow in the UI. It will invite you to "create a PR" from your newly published branch. Fill out the PR template to submit a PR.
8. Finally, the Amplify team will review your PR. Add reviewers based on the core member who is tracking the issue with you or code owners.
   _In the meantime, address any automated check that fail (such as linting, unit tests, etc. in CI)_

# Release

We follow semantic versioning for our releases.

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/labels/help%20wanted) or ['good first issue'](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is a great place to start.

You could also contribute by reporting bugs, reproduction of bugs with sample code, documentation and test improvements.

## Related Repositories

The Amplify Framework runs on Android, iOS, and numerous JavaScript-based web platforms.

1. [AWS Amplify for iOS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios)
2. [AWS Amplify for Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android)
3. [AWS Amplify JS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js)

AWS Amplify plugins are built on top of the AWS SDKs. AWS SDKs are a
toolkit for interacting with AWS backend resources.

1. [AWS SDK for Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android)
2. [AWS SDK for iOS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios)
3. [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js)

## Unit Tests

To run all the flutter unit tests for all plugins:

```bash
$ melos run test:unit:flutter
```

or run all unit tests for a given platform
```bash
$ melos run test:unit:android
$ melos run test:unit:ios
```

## Integration Tests

In addition to unit tests which mock Amplify API interaction, this repository has integration tests which
test functionality with real Amplify back-ends. The integration test script will execute tests in example
apps which have integration tests written (skipping those that don't). It runs on Android and iOS simulators.

**Note:** To run integration tests, you will need prerequisite Amplify resources in the example
apps where the tests run. The process for creating those is noted below. You will also need to install dependencies with `melos bootstrap`.

To run all integration tests on available platforms:

```bash
$ melos run test:integration
```

To run tests for all packages on a single platform (replace `android` with `ios` to run on iOS):

```bash
$ melos run test:integration:android --no-select
```

To run tests for a single package on a single platform (replace `android` with `ios` to run on iOS):

> Note: you will be prompted with which package to run the tests for

```bash
$ melos run test:integration:android
```

To run a single test file on device matching "sdk":

```bash
$ cd packages/amplify_auth_cognito/example
$ flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/sign_in_sign_out_test.dart -d sdk
```

## Provision Resources For Integration Tests

Any app with integration tests will have a script `tool/provision_integration_test_resources.sh` which will call `amplify init` and `amplify push` with preconfigured amplify environments for that app.
Executing it will create real AWS resources. It requires [the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli). It does not need to run every time you run the tests. Run it once to set up or update your environments.
If you already have an amplify environment configured for an app, this command will create a "test"
environment and check it out.

Create all the amplify environments in the example apps which have provisioning scripts (takes several minutes). Note that you may need to give yourself permission to execute the scripts.:

```bash
$ melos run provision_integration_test_resources
```

Note: you will need to have [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) installed, which you can install by running `brew install jq`.
The provisioning script uses the [Amplify CLI headless mode](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/usage/headless).

The auth tests require some additional configuration to support lambda triggers for automatically
verifying temporary test users. Note that this should only be done for the test environment, never a production one. This can be done manually by [following this process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html#aws-lambda-triggers-pre-registration-example-2) or by following these instructions for the amplify CLI:

```
$ cd packages/amplify_auth_cognito/example
$ amplify update auth
  Please note that certain attributes may not be overwritten if you choose to use defaults settings.
  Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation
  What do you want to do?

    Your verification code
  Please specify an email verification message:
    Your verification code is {####}
  Do you want to override the default password policy for this User Pool?
    No

  Do you want to use an OAuth flow?
    No
  ? Do you want to configure Lambda Triggers for Cognito?
    Yes
  ? Which triggers do you want to enable for Cognito
    Pre Sign-up
  ? What functionality do you want to use for Pre Sign-up
    Create your own module
  Successfully added resource authintegrationtestPreSignup locally.
```

When prompted to edit the function now, choose "yes" and add the following code to the `custom.js` file
created by the amplify CLI, from [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html#aws-lambda-triggers-pre-registration-example-2).

```js
exports.handler = async event => {
  // Confirm the user
  event.response.autoConfirmUser = true;

  // Set the email as verified if it is in the request
  if (event.request.userAttributes.hasOwnProperty("email")) {
    event.response.autoVerifyEmail = true;
  }

  // Set the phone number as verified if it is in the request
  if (event.request.userAttributes.hasOwnProperty("phone_number")) {
    event.response.autoVerifyPhone = true;
  }

  // Return to Amazon Cognito
  return event;
};
```

Finally, run a push to update the resources with the new function resource (lambda trigger):

```bash
$ amplify push
```

Additionally, the storage category requires some manual configuration as the [headless CLI does not yet support storage](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/7378). Those instructions
are notes in the [storage example app](packages/amplify_storage_s3/example/README.md).
