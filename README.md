## Amplify Flutter

AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service. See [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws) for further details about the Amplify Framework.

We are iterating and looking for feedback and collaboration, so please [**let us know your feedback**](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/5) on our direction and roadmap.

## Flutter Development Guide

Amplify for Flutter is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the Flutter community, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/flutter#option-1-watch-the-video-guide)

#### Getting Started with Flutter app development and Amplify

- Clone this repository
- Install Amplify in a Flutter project
- Add basic Amplify functionality to your project using one of the supported categories

1. Open your Flutter project. If you do not have an active Flutter project, you can create one after installing the [Flutter development tooling](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and running `flutter create <project-name>` in your terminal.

2. Using the Amplify CLI, run `amplify init` from the root of your project:

See [Amplify CLI Installation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/flutter#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli)

```bash
==> amplify init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project <project-name>
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: <project-name>
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: flutter
| Configuration file location: ./lib/

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

4. Add Amplify categories (choose defaults for this example):

   ```bash
   $ amplify add auth
   $ amplify add analytics
   ```

5. Push changes to the cloud to provision the backend resources:

   ```bash
   $ amplify push
   ```

6. In your pubspec.yaml file, add the following to `dependencies`:

> Note: Do not include dependencies in your `pubspec` file that you are not using in your app. This can cause a configuration error in the underlying SDK.

```yaml
dependencies:
  amplify_analytics_pinpoint: ^1.0.0
  amplify_auth_cognito: ^1.0.0
  amplify_authenticator: ^1.0.0
  amplify_flutter: ^1.0.0
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
```

7. From the terminal run

```bash
flutter pub get
```

8. In your main.dart file, add:

```dart
import 'package:amplify_analytics_pinpoint/amplify_analytics_pinpoint.dart';
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  var _amplifyConfigured = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify();
  }

  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    // Add Pinpoint and Cognito Plugins
    await Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito());
    await Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint());

    // Once Plugins are added, configure Amplify
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
    setState(() {
      _amplifyConfigured = true;
    });
  }

  // Send an event to Pinpoint
  Future<void> _recordEvent() async {
    final event = AnalyticsEvent('test');
    event.customProperties.addBoolProperty('boolKey', true);
    event.customProperties.addDoubleProperty('doubleKey', 10);
    event.customProperties.addIntProperty('intKey', 10);
    event.customProperties.addStringProperty('stringKey', 'stringValue');
    await Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent(event: event);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Authenticator(
      child: MaterialApp(
        builder: Authenticator.builder(),
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text('Amplify Example App'),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Column(children: [
              const Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(5)),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _amplifyConfigured ? null : _configureAmplify,
                child: const Text('Configure Amplify'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _amplifyConfigured ? _recordEvent : null,
                child: const Text('Record Event'),
              ),
            ]),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

9. Before you can run the app, some extra configuration may be required for each platform. Check out the [Platform Setup](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/platform-setup/q/platform/flutter/) guide to make sure you've completed the necessary steps.

10. Run `flutter run` to launch your app on the connected device.

11. Once the app is loaded, tap on **Configure Amplify**, then on **Record Event** a few times.

12. To see the events you recoded, run `amplify console analytics`. This will open the Amazon Pinpoint console for your project in your default web browser. Within about a minute you should start seeing the events populating in the Events section of then Pinpoint console.

Congratulations, you've built your first Amplify app! ðŸŽ‰
