## Amplify Flutter

AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service. See [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws) for further details about the Amplify Framework.

We are iterating and looking for feedback and collaboration, so please [**let us know your feedback**](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/5) on our direction and roadmap.

[Getting Started Guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/setup/q/integration/flutter)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Amplify Flutter v1 is deprecated as of April 30th, 2025. No new features or bug fixes will be added. Dependencies may become outdated and potentially introduce compatibility issues.**

Please use the latest version (Gen 2) of Amplify Flutter. If you are currently using v1, follow [these instructions](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/upgrade-guide/q/platform/flutter/) to upgrade to v2.

### Semantic versioning

We follow [semantic versioning](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning#semantic-versions) for our releases.

#### Semantic versioning and enumeration cases

When Amplify adds a new enumeration entry or sealed class subtype, we will publish a new **minor** version of the library.

Applications that use a `switch` statement to evaluate all members of an enumerated type can add a `default` clause to prevent
new cases from causing compile warnings or errors.

#### Semantic versioning and dependencies update

We follow [semantic versioning for updating our dependencies](https://semver.org/#what-should-i-do-if-i-update-my-own-dependencies-without-changing-the-public-api). This includes updating the dart and flutter SDK version.

## Documentation

- [Getting Started with Amplify Flutter](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/start/quickstart/)
- [Amplify Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/)
- [Contributing to Amplify Flutter](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Flutter Development Guide

Amplify for Flutter is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the Flutter community, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Node.js v18.17 or later
- npm v9 or later

#### Getting Started With Amplify Flutter

1. Open your Flutter project. If you do not have an active Flutter project, you can create one after installing the [Flutter development tooling](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and running `flutter create <project-name>` in your terminal.

2. Run the following to create an amplify project:

    `npm create amplify@latest -y`

4. To use the Authenticator, you need to add the following dependencies to your project:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      amplify_auth_cognito: ^2.0.0
      amplify_authenticator: ^2.0.0
      amplify_flutter: ^2.0.0
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
    ```

5. run `flutter pub get`

6. Update your main.dart file to the following:

```dart
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'amplify_outputs.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  try {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await _configureAmplify();
    runApp(const MyApp());
  } on AmplifyException catch (e) {
    runApp(Text("Error configuring Amplify: ${e.message}"));
  }
}

Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
  try {
    await Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito());
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyConfig);
    safePrint('Successfully configured');
  } on Exception catch (e) {
    safePrint('Error configuring Amplify: $e');
  }
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Authenticator(
      child: MaterialApp(
        builder: Authenticator.builder(),
        home: const Scaffold(
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                SignOutButton(),
                Text('TODO Application'),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

7. Deploy your backend use Amplify's per-developer cloud sandbox. This feature provides a separate backend environment for every developer on a team, ideal for local development and testing. To run your application with a sandbox environment, you can run the following command:

    `npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format dart --outputs-out-dir lib`

8. Since Amplify Flutter supports 6 platforms with Flutter including iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop, some extra configuration may be required for each platform. Check out the [Platform Setup](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/start/platform-setup/) guide to make sure you've completed the necessary steps.

9. Run `flutter run` to launch your app on the connected device.

Congratulations, you've built your first Amplify app! üéâ
