## AWS Amplify Flutter (Developer Preview) is a library for Flutter developers building cloud-enabled applications

AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any Flutter based frontend workflow, and React Native for mobile developers.

Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service.

## Features / APIs

- [**Authentication**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/flutter): APIs and building blocks to create user authentication experiences.
- [**Analytics**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/flutter): Collect analytics data for your app. Analytics data includes user sessions and other custom events that you want to track in your app.
- [**Storage**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/flutter): Provides a simple mechanism for managing user content for your app in public, protected or private storage buckets.

## Known Issues

- Hosted UI - TBD
- What else?

### To Be Implmented

 - API (REST/GraphQL)
 - Predictions
 - Datastore
 - Hub Events (Listening to the Amplify events)
 - [**FEEDBACK**](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/5)


#### Visit our [Web Site](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to learn more about AWS Amplify.

## Local Development Guide

Amplify-Flutter is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the Flutter community.


### Getting Started with Local Development

The following instructions will help you:

* Pull the Amplify-Flutter project.
* Install it in a project for local development.
* Add basic Amplify functionality to your project.





1. Clone the Amplify-Flutter [GitHub repository](git@github.com:aws-amplify/amplify-flutter.git).

2. Open your Flutter project. If you do not have an active Flutter project, you can create one after installing the [Flutter development tooling](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and running the `flutter create <project-name>` command.

3. Using the Amplify-CLI, run `amplify init` from the root of your project:

```bash
==> amplify-dev init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project helloAmplify
? Enter a name for the environment dev
? Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code
? Choose the type of app that you\'re building flutter
Please tell us about your project
⚠️  Flutter project support in the Amplify CLI is in DEVELOPER PREVIEW status.
Currently, the following resource types are supported:
 * Auth
 * Analytics
 * Storage
Other categories may not function as expected for Flutter projects.
? Where do you want to store your configuration file? ./lib/
```

4. Run `amplify analytics add`, follow the defaults and be sure indicate that you want to add authorization. Next, run `amplify push`. 

5. In your pubspec.yaml file, add the following:

```yaml
  amplify_core:
    path: /{path to your local amplify-flutter}/amplify-flutter/packages/amplify_core 
  amplify_analytics_pinpoint:
    path: /{path to your local amplify-flutter}/amplify-flutter/packages/amplify_analytics_pinpoint
  amplify_auth_cognito:
    path: /{path to your local amplify-flutter}/amplify-flutter/packages/amplify_auth_cognito
```

6. In your main.dart file, add:

```dart
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_core/amplify_core.dart';
import 'package:amplify_analytics_pinpoint/amplify_analytics_pinpoint.dart';
import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  bool _amplifyConfigured = false;

  // Instantiate Amplify
  Amplify amplifyInstance = new Amplify();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  void _configureAmplify() async {
    if (!mounted) return;

    // Add Pinpoint and Cognito Plugins
    AmplifyAnalyticsPinpointPlugin analyticsPlugin = new AmplifyAnalyticsPinpointPlugin();
    AmplifyAuthCognito authPlugin = new AmplifyAuthCognito();
    amplifyInstance.addPlugin(authPlugins: [authPlugin]);
    amplifyInstance.addPlugin(analyticsPlugins: [analyticsPlugin]);

    // Once Plugins are added, configure Amplify
    await amplifyInstance.configure(amplifyconfig);
    try {
      setState(() {
        _amplifyConfigured = true;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print(e);
    }

  }

  // Send an event to Pinpoint
  void _recordEvent() async {
    AnalyticsEvent event = AnalyticsEvent("test");
    event.properties.addBoolProperty("boolKey", true);
    event.properties.addDoubleProperty("doubleKey", 10.0);
    event.properties.addIntProperty("intKey", 10);
    event.properties.addStringProperty("stringKey", "stringValue");
    Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent(event: event);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text('Amplify Core example app'),
          ),
          body: ListView(padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.0), children: <Widget>[
            Center( 
              child: Column (
                children: [
                  const Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(5.0)),
                  RaisedButton(
                    onPressed: _amplifyConfigured ? null : _configureAmplify,
                    child: const Text('configure Amplify')
                  ),
                  RaisedButton(
                    onPressed: _amplifyConfigured ? _recordEvent : null,
                    child: const Text('record event')
                  )
                ]
              ),
            )
          ])
      )
    );
  }
}
```

7. In order to get iOS builds to work do the following within Command Line:
- Go to the root of your project
- Run: "rm ios/Podfile"
- Run: "flutter build ios"
- Modify ios/Podfile -> replace the second line with: "platform :ios, '11.0'

This step ensures that your flutter project is running the same ios version that our Flutter plugins are built on.



8. From the root of your project, execute `flutter pub get` and `flutter run` from your terminal.
Make sure that an Android or iOS device is already running; this can be a virutal device started from Android Studio.
